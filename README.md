# Advent of Code 2017

I'm not sure how far I'll get in it, but I'm starting to play with the
[Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com) in Julia.  I'm only on
'day' 3 (though I did them all in 1 night...). I figure if nothing
else this is a good chance to write a good chunk of Julia and maybe
start to get my head around it more so I can write better Julia at
some point. :)
